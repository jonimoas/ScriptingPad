Part of the collection of the programs i started writing when i was 13 years old.

This is the my first ever program, created in VS6
As you can see, it is a really primitive IDE for HTML, DOS and autoruns for cd/dvd

I used the VS2008 update wizard to bring it up to speed

The folder first-exe contains the first ever iteration, only compatible with bat files.

Sadly i have lost the sources :(
